Products Grid challenge
====

Hello and first of all thank you very much for reviewing my challenge.


To start first download all the CR_CHAL repository ($git clone https://github.com/lucasninjaturtle/creat_ch.git), on a new folder you created ($mkdir yourFolder) inside you'll find:

- back => inside this repository 1) npm install, 2) npm start   {and you are running the back on localhost:3002}

- creat_ch_cli ___ first you need to download this repository too so go: $cd creat_ch git clone https://github.com/lucasninjaturtle/creat_ch_cli.git

=> inside this repository 1) npm install, 2) npm start    {and you are running the front-end on localhost:3000}


Walktrough of my process:

- Made a git submodule for my new project.
- Started my project by fetching data and showing it on screen.
- Started creating my folders and components, understading what I need basically.
- Started with sort... but changed my mind because I thought the flux wrong, so later I changed that.
- Worked on the catalog (infinite scroll).
- Correcting my sort.
- Started getting some styles.
- got the image on frontend
- made the date feature.
- corrections.
